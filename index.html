            # State Management

            ## The Scenario

            > Online incident management with self-reporting resolution.

            ----

            ## Implementation Approach

            * service to manage incident list
              * loading
              * mark incident as resolved              
            * component manages file upload
            * component manages sign-off

            ----

            ## New Requirement

            ![lumbergh](assets/lumbergh.jpg)<!-- .element: height="200px"-->

            > Users may take a few days to update an incident. Let's implement an autosave to prevent lost work.

            ----

            ## Exponential Complexity

            * issue resolution is independent of data entry
            * user closes issues before upload finishes'
            * list updates asynchronously 
            * issues could be marked as resolved before images finish uploading
            * user could delete images after issue is marked as resolved

            ## State Management

            > You've been doing it all along.  But it can be done better.

            ----

            ## Advantages

            * centralize business logic (dumber components)
            * event hooks for ui and workflow
            * optimize client-side performance
            * help catch errors
            * makes testing easier

            ----

            ## Disadvantages

            * more layers of abstraction
            * increases app complexity

            ----

            ## Development Assumption

            > Apps grow in complexity over time.  State management helps manage the complexity as feature sets grow.

            ---

            ## Redux

            [Redux Docs](https://redux.js.org/)

            * One of many systems for managing state
            * Born from the React world
            * framework independent
            * Ecosystem of tools

            ----

            ## Redux Flow

            ![Redux Flow](assets/redux-flow.png)

            ----

            ## Store

            * holds the _state_ for the whole application in a single object tree
            * immutable   
            * Application reacts to the _state_ 

            ----

            ## Actions

            > ... you can think of an action as an event that describes something that happened in the application

            * simple object minimally defined by a `type`
            * describes an event that occur
            * sometimes has payload data

            ----

            ## Reducer

            > A plain function that receives actions and the current state, and produces a new state object

            ---

            ## Angular Based Libraries

            * [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/)
            * [NgXS](https://www.ngxs.io/)
            * [Akita](https://datorama.github.io/akita/)

            ----

            ## NgRx

            * Redux implementation targeting Angular
            * Isolates side effects
            * Integrates with angular router
            * Compatible with [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en_)

            ----

            ![NgRx Flow](assets/ngrx-flow.png)

            ----

            ## Effects

            * Manages asynchronous flow
            * Watches for actions, and produces one or more new actions
            * Example: LoadData Action

            ----

            ## Selectors

            * memoized functions that react to state changes
            * observable
            * good for derived values
              * states: `uninitialized`, `loading`, `loaded`, `saving`, `error`
              * selector: `isBusy`

            ---

            ## One More Layer

            ![Layers](assets/ogre-layers.webp)

            ----

            ## Fa√ßade Pattern

            * Is an Angular service
            * Acts as the inbound/outbound proxy to the store
            * Unifies in-bound and out-bound flow for consuming components
            * Update routes
            * Components don't need to understand actions

            ----

            ## Api Service

            * manages just api calls
            * transforms http errors to logical errors
